# Privacy Policy for Platten App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Platten app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our app. This policy outlines our data handling practices.

## Data Collection and Use

The Platten app is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data off your device. All data generated through your use of the app (such as exercise logs and settings) is stored locally on your device using Android's Room database and DataStore.

## Data Storage

- **Exercise Data**: All your exercise logs and related information are stored locally on your device using Room database.
- **App Settings**: Your app preferences are stored locally using Android's DataStore.

We do not have access to this data, nor is it transmitted off your device.

## Third-Party Libraries

We use several third-party libraries to provide functionality within the app:

- MPAndroidChart: Used for creating charts. This library does not collect or transmit any data.
- AndroidX libraries: These are standard Android development libraries and do not collect personal data.

## Crash Reporting

The app may send crash reports to help us improve the app's stability. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information.

## For Non-Pro Version Users (Google AdMob)

If you are using the non-pro version of Platten from the Google Play Store, please note:

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and process data as described in Google's Privacy Policy. This may include:

## Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties, as we do not collect or store any data outside of your device.
